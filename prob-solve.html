    <h1>The Problem</h1>

    <p> The problem with wasteful paper usage is that it will lead to deforestation, since trees are used to make paper. Many schools all over the world waste too much paper every day. When teachers create worksheets they have to print out a copy for every student. There are about 25-30 students in every class which means that the teacher has to print out about 30 sheets for each class. </p>

    <h1>The Solution</h1>
    <p>
      The proposed solution to the huge wasteful paper usage problem in schools is to start using electronic devices. Since the DOE has already given students and teachers access to devices, everyone should be able to get one for school work. This means that this proposed solution does not need much money or investment to make the change. The change of using devices instead of paper will significantly decrease the amount of paper used, printed, and wasted at school. Teachers will no longer have to print huge stacks of worksheets and homeworks because everything will be online and teachers and students won't need to carry much in their bags; which will also help with back issues.
