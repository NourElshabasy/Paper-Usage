    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>Did you know that approximately 1 billion trees worth of paper are thrown away each year in the United States.
      Studies have shown that Americans use approximately 85,000,000 tons of paper a year; about 680 pounds per person
      and that’s A LOT. Paper was invented in 105 A.D., although paper is very useful, people have been misusing and
      wasting it. This is most prominent in schools where both teachers and students use paper on a daily basis.
      Wasteful paper consumption may lead to environmental problems like deforestation. Imagine being a tree in a
      forest, in your mind imagine you are being chopped down and turned to paper and having people misuse you. Would
      you be happy? No, right? It’s just like being cheated on, okay, well, that might be even worse? No one wants to
      live in a world with no trees which is why we believe this is an important problem that needs to be solved.
      Therefore, paper waste is a serious problem in today’s world and in the future. </p>

    <p>So our team came up with an idea, which might save the future generation from deforestation. We spent about an
      hour and 30 minutes every 2 days for almost every week after school to pitch ideas to help solve this serious
      problem and look for a perfect websites which will allow teachers to make worksheets online and allow students to
      work on them and submit them for teachers to grade. </p>
